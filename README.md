INTRODUCTION:


Managing responsibilities—whether in college, work, or daily life—can often become overwhelming without the right tools. We've all experienced moments where tasks slip through the cracks or team coordination breaks down simply because there isn’t a clear system in place. This common problem inspired us to create Kartavya—a task management platform built to bring structure, clarity, and accountability to everyday work.

The name Kartavya, which means “duty” or “responsibility” in Hindi, reflects what we believe in: taking ownership of our roles and working together effectively. Our aim was to design something that doesn’t just help users stay organized but also encourages a mindset of commitment and teamwork. Whether you're a student managing assignments or part of a team working on a group project, Kartavya helps you keep track of what needs to be done—and who’s doing it.

From the start, we wanted Kartavya to be simple, accessible, and useful. That’s why we included features like a clean calendar view, task tracking, role-based access, and an intuitive user experience. It’s built in a way that anyone can use it without needing to learn complicated tools or systems.

This project has been a collaborative journey for our team—Mukul, Harshit, Divyansh and me. Each of us contributed in our own way, sharing ideas, solving problems, and learning a lot along the way. Kartavya is more than just a software tool; it’s a reflection of our shared belief in the power of responsibility, and in the value of working together.
