📖 Introduction
Managing responsibilities—whether in college, at work, or in daily life—can often become overwhelming without the right tools. We've all experienced times when tasks slip through the cracks or team coordination falters simply due to the absence of a clear system.

This common problem inspired us to create Kartavya—a task management platform designed to bring structure, clarity, and accountability to everyday workflows.

The name Kartavya, which means “duty” or “responsibility” in Hindi, reflects the core philosophy behind our platform: taking ownership of our roles and collaborating effectively. Whether you're a student juggling assignments or part of a project team, Kartavya helps you keep track of what needs to be done—and who is doing it.

🎯 Key Objectives
Encourage a responsible and team-oriented mindset

Provide a simple, accessible, and intuitive task management solution

Build a tool that anyone can use without needing complex training

🔧 Core Features
🗓️ Clean and interactive calendar view

✅ Task tracking with status updates

👥 Role-based access for different user levels

💡 User-friendly and intuitive UI/UX design

🤝 Team Collaboration
This project has been a collaborative journey. From brainstorming ideas to debugging features, each team member—Mukul, Harshit, Divyansh, and Aaradhya—played a crucial role. Kartavya stands not just as a working product, but as a reflection of our shared values: responsibility, teamwork, and continuous learning.
